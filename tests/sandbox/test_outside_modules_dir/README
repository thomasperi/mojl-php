In this test, the test_* folder does not act as the document root,
because the test needs to ensure that any attempt to load a module outside
the modules directory fails.

A module name of '../foo' produces a module path of

	htdocs/modules/../foo/../foo.php

which resolves to
	
	htdocs/foo.php

which should not be able to load, even though it exists.
